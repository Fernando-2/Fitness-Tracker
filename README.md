# Fitness-Tracker
The fitness tracker allows you to input workouts and keep track of them allows you to put select data about workout
# How It Works and technologies used
This application is made using mongodb javascript and deployed using mongo atlas and heroku 
## Starting the code
I started out with making the models index.js and workout.js think of workout js the table for the information with bit a code for how long a workout is and such while index.js is just exporting the workout.
### Then
I made all the html routes to switch from page to page as well as the api routes to get post and put data
